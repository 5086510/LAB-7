# Lab Assignment 7  
**Word Frequency Histogram Generator**  

The purpose of this lab assignment is to implement a program that reads a text input file, processes the content to calculate word frequencies, letter frequencies, and character counts, and generates a vertical histogram to visualize the word frequency distribution.


### Supporting Functions:
- **`initializeLetterFreq`**: Initializes letter frequency counters for all letters (A-Z, a-z).
- **`getNextWord`**: Extracts words from input lines.
- **`processFile`**: Processes the input text file, calculates word and letter frequencies, and updates statistics.
- **`printVerticalHistogram`**: Generates a vertical histogram to visually represent word frequencies, with appropriate alignment and formatting.



## Usage:

To run the program, simply compile and execute the provided C++ code.

### Example:

g++ main.cpp dictionary.cpp -o main


./main < data.txt
